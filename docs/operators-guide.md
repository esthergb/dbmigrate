# Operators Guide (Draft)

## Intended workflow

1. Run `dbmigrate plan` and review compatibility warnings.
2. Run baseline migration (`dbmigrate migrate`).
3. Run periodic incremental sync (`dbmigrate replicate`).
4. Run verification (`dbmigrate verify`).
5. Generate machine-readable report (`dbmigrate report --json`).

## Safety defaults

- Fail fast on known incompatible features.
- Use conservative conflict policy (`fail`).
- Use explicit DDL policy via `--apply-ddl`.

## Rollback strategy (to refine)

- Take source and destination backups before baseline migration.
- Keep replication checkpoints immutable per successful run.
- If verification fails, stop apply loop and inspect report before retry.
